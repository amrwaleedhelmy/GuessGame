# GuessGame
JavaFX & Eclipse were used for the project implementation in Windows Programming (CMPE 361), which was about building an application that contains a dropdown menu for two different games:
"Guess The Number" is the first game where the user must guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. If the player gives up, they reveal the correct answer. If the player reveals the answer or correctly guesses the number, a pop-up window will appear to ask them to continue or quit the game.
"Math Quiz Game" is the second game where the player must enter their username and select the right answer for the equation ax = b where a is a number between 0 and 10, and b is a's multiple. The advanced version involves a being between the range of 11 & 100. The player can change the font size and theme of the game to their own preference.
